# Cybersecurity Game

Developed for the **Cyber Education for Teens Hackathon**.

---

## Concept Overview

In this game, the world is represented as a network of connected devices:
- **IoT devices**, **computers**, **servers**, and **smartphones** are distributed across the world based on real population density.
- A **digital virus** starts at one random node and spreads across connections.
- Players will later act as defenders, containing the infection through cybersecurity strategies such as:
  - Patching vulnerabilities  
  - Deploying firewalls  
  - Scanning for intrusions  
  - Training user awareness
