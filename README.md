# üß† Cybersecurity Game

An educational, strategy-based cybersecurity simulation inspired by *Plague Inc.*  
Players must defend a connected digital world from a spreading cyber infection by deploying firewalls, patches, scans, and awareness campaigns.

Developed for the **Cyber Education for Teens Hackathon**, this project aims to make cybersecurity learning fun, visual, and interactive for 16-year-olds with general tech knowledge.

## üéØ Concept Overview

In this game, the world is represented as a network of connected devices:
- **IoT devices**, **computers**, **servers**, and **smartphones** are distributed across the world based on real population density.
- A **digital virus** starts at one random node and spreads across connections.
- Players will later act as defenders, containing the infection through cybersecurity strategies such as:
  - Patching vulnerabilities  
  - Deploying firewalls  
  - Scanning for intrusions  
  - Training user awareness  

This repository contains multiple branches representing different development stages and prototypes (e.g., Codex-generated versions, defense-mode builds, and simulation logic).
